# Browser Debug MCP Bridge Documentation

This site is the primary documentation platform for the Browser Debug MCP Bridge.

Use it to move from first run to day-to-day debugging:

- Start with [Quick Start](./getting-started/quick-start.md)
- Use [Install And MCP Client Setup](./getting-started/install-and-client-setup.md) for cross-client MCP integration
- Query sessions using [MCP Tools](./mcp-tools/overview.md)
- Validate guardrails in [Security & Privacy](./security-privacy/controls.md)
- Fix common setup/runtime problems in [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting/common-issues.md)

This docs site focuses on end-user usage of the extension and MCP tools.
