# Browser Debug MCP Bridge Documentation

This site is the primary documentation platform for the Browser Debug MCP Bridge.

Use it to move from first run to deep failure analysis:

- Start with [Quick Start](./getting-started/quick-start.md)
- Learn system shape in [Architecture](./architecture/overview.md)
- Query sessions using [MCP Tools](./mcp-tools/overview.md)
- Validate guardrails in [Security & Privacy](./security-privacy/controls.md)
- Debug incidents with the [Failure Diagnosis Playbook](./workflows/failure-diagnosis-playbook.md)

Legacy markdown references are mapped into this structure from `PROJECT_INFOS.md` and `docs/*`.
